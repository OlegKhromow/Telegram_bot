# Telegram chat bot on Python

This bot is designed to help you buy a car. Answer questions about the car and get recommendations for buying a car ðŸ¤–ðŸš—

It was created by me using **Python** and **fuzzy logic** principles for decision making.
The automated system was previously created in MatLab Fuzzy Logic Designer.
The Telegram bot was created using the https://t.me/BotFather

You need to pre-download two packages, for creating Bot and fuzzy system:
